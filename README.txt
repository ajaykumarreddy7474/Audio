Task-2:
- Music Player with HTML, CSS, JavaScript-
- ---------------------------------------

I created an audio player with the added functionality of a custom speed control feature. The features that I have inserted into this audio player are:

1 Ability to adjust playback speed with three different speeds.  
2 Skip the song to the next.
3 Change the volume of the song.
4 Forward and Backward the song using the progress bar.

  --------------------------------------------------

-This audio player is built in such a way that it will work across different devices and browsers for compatibility and responsiveness.

-The main used entities are DOM manipulation, which will modify and change elements of the HTML.
  --------------------------------------------------

Implementation details :

1. For HTML structure :  Necessary elements for controlling the audio playback, such as buttons for play/pause, volume control, and a slider for speed control.

2. JavaScript Event Handling :  Used JavaScript to handle user interactions with the speed control slider.

3. User Experience: Provided feedback to the user about displaying the speed value next to the slider.

4. Browser Compatibility: Ensured speed adjustment works correctly across different browsers and devices. 


Challenges faced : 

1. Browser compatibility entity is quite a bit difficult to implement.  Took care to ensure that this website rendered consistently across various web browsers.

2. User interactions and Experience must be smoothly created without confusing users can be a design challenge.

3. Performance must be optimized while using the particular functionality, so the maintaining consistent smooth experience is quite challenging.
